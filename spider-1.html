<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Spiders have been around for about 400 million years with their habitat preferences&mdash;terrestrial&mdash;and physical anatomy remaining relatively unchanged.[1] They are feared and hated across countries, generations, and cultures (for more nuanced examination of this see Davey, 1994).
<br>
<br>
This long history with humans motivates theories that fear towards spiders is a biological response, where a reaction to an external threat is passed down genetically creating biological preparredness to stimuli.[2] [3] Though today, it is estimated only .01% of all species of spiders can dangerously effect humans.[4]
<br>
<br>
Other theories address the disgust people feel towards spiders as the same disgust developed to prevent humans from getting sick.[5] This phenomena is called pathogen digust, or pathogen avoidance. Spiders do not transmit diseases nor are poisonous to humans, through their presence when ingested, or through infection when bitten.[6] [7] But the identification that the feeling of disgust is the same in the human brain when reacting to both spiders and disease can help to address negative misinformation about spiders that shapes human perception.
<br>
<br>
A third theory, urbanization&#45;disgust, explains the reason for these responses by saying that increased urbanization has has reduced knowledge about spiders, and increased the frequency of seeing spiders indoors, causing more intensity and breadth of emotional reactions when a spider is encountered.[8]
<br>
<br>
Related to this are variables that cause people to be afraid of spiders. Scientists found four vulnerability variables that effect human fear responses towards spiders: perceived uncontrollability, unpredictability, dangerousness, and disgustingness.[9] This idea that when spiders enter a space humans believe they have control over, this perceived loss of control, danger, disgust, and inability to predict a spider&#39;s movements creates a strong reaction that supports the urbanization&#45;disgust theory, where indoors, a place of control, human&#39;s reactions are greater.
<br>
<br></p>
<h2>The Map</h2>
<p>To test this third theory, I mapped every spider&#45;human event recorded in the dataset with a purple triangle. Some triangles have multiple pop-ups to scroll through, this is because multiple articles have reported on the same event. As another layer, the world&#39;s population density for every 1km provided by Ersi is shown. With this it is possible to see where the events occurred in relation to population density, and by assumption human infrastructure.

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In my mind, this relates the presence of spiders or any insect in our homes to intruders, where force by any means necessary to get them out is viewed as socially and in some places, legally acceptable. But just as arguments of self-defense are problematized when a situation is examined, why are people moved to violence towards someone that could never incapacitate them, overtake them, it could at most cause them mild skin discomfort or a trip to the doctor? 
<br>
<br>
People&#39;s reactions to spiders and the financial, physical, and mental toll of the medical system are serious, but zooming out from spider&#45;human encounters, it is curious that something the size of a dime causes so much terror. Similar phenomena is seen in reaction to small, and even harmless creatures like mice, slugs, cockroaches, ants, and house centipedes. What&#39;s the worst that could happen?</p>

    <h2>Is a more detailed perspective possible?</h2>
    <p>Trying to push the data further, I wanted to see how many of these events took place indoors. Using OpenRefine&#39;s text filters on the titles solely in English, I filtered for known words in the dataset relating to indoor spaces like <b>plane</b> and <b>grapes,</b> and guesses for common words related to being inside like <b>house, home, building, office.</b> This graph represents how many article titles contain each word.<br><br></p>
    <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13165083"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
    <br>
    <p>While searching, many terms related to spiders found inside or on parts of the body such as the ear, skin, leg, hand, stomach, and face came up. Removing these instances from the totals related to each indoor-space keyword, I tallied them up separately. Body part related keywords totalled 452 articles, just ahead of the total of all the indoor keywords at 329. Having a spider on or in your body could be considered the ultimate type of indoor invasion.</p>
    <br>
    <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13167475"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
    <br>
      <p>This is an imperfect method, as much of the articles reamined ungrouped. Searching by keyword also meant each article needed to be checked ensuring it accurately represented the keyword used. The data is not able to adequately support this level of granularity. Adding fields for indoor, outdoor, and body&#45;related that code each event from the articles collected, could start to explore how taxon-related features, like distribution habits or the relationship to the human during the event, correlate to the sensationalism, quality of the article, and intense human reactions.
