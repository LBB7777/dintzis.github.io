      <h2>Spiders: Foe or Friend?</h2>
      <p>Spiders are widely hated and feared, despite being essential members of our ecosystems. Arachnophobia, the uncontrollable fear of spiders, is one of the most common animal-specific phobias. Social media videos of spiders have gone viral, getting views into the millions, with comments like &ldquo;run&rdquo;, &ldquo;leave your home&rdquo;, reacting to spiders no bigger than a fingernail. But why do spiders illicit such strong reactions, even from behind the safety of our phone screens?
        <br>
        <br>
        In psychology and neurology, it is still not understood why humans have such strong reactions of fear and disgust to spiders.
        <br>
        <br>
      <h2>The Data</h2>
       <p>In 2022 Stefano Mammola and others published a global database of online news articles from 2010 to 2020, reporting on encounters between spiders and humans. It collects information on the article&#39;s content, such as the spider event in the news article, whether photographs were present, identification errors, sensationalized language, and the encounter result&mdash;bite or deadly bite. The title of the article, the title of the newspaper, location, and distribution type were also collected about the news articles themselves.
        <br>
        <br>
        The database covers 6,205 news articles covering 5,347 unique news articles from 81 countries in 40 languages. The database refers to 209 identified and unidentified spider species and 2,644 unique encounters between spiders and humans. I downloaded the dataset in the available Excel file format. I then converted it into a CSV file. All cleaning and manipulations were done in Excel and OpenRefine. These edits were mostly to make the data more readable when put into visualizations, such as changing 1s and 0s to corresponding yes and no. Some coordinates needed to be altered, correcting for points located in the ocean when they were meant to be on land.
      <br>  
      <br>
        The Map was created using ArcGIS and Ersi WorldPop population density data layer. All of the other data vizualizations were made using Flourish.
        <br>
