<h2>Crowdsourcing for Reuse: Imagining the Participatory Archive</h2>
<h3>IS 438B: Archival Description and Access | Professor Jonathan Furner | Winter 2022</h3>
<div class="columns">
  <div class="column">
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>
	Crowdsourcing is not a new concept, originating even before the rise of the World Wide Web, but primarily taking hold in the early 2000s. It was built around emerging Web 2.0 capabilities at the time like Del.icio.us and Flickr, where user communities could interact, socialize, and collaborate over shared content. In its use with digital heritage and the humanities, Mia Ridge offers the definition of crowdsourcing as, “an emerging form of engagement […] that contributes towards a shared, significant goal or research area by asking the public to undertake tasks that cannot be done automatically, in an environment where the tasks, goals (or both) provide inherent rewards for participation.”<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>  This definition is fairly vague, but is important because it speaks to a symbiotic relationship between the users, referred to as the nebulous public, and the institution or environment, recognizing that each has different motivations, and places responsibility on each to meet each other’s needs. While acknowledging Ridge’s definition, Melissa Terras offers another, “the harnessing of online activities and behavior to aid in large‐scale ventures such as tagging, commenting, rating, reviewing, text correcting, and the creation and uploading of content in a methodical, task‐based fashion to improve the quality of, and widen access to, online collections."<sup><a href="#2">2 </a><a href="#3">3</a></sup> This definition places emphasis on the way tasks will be carried out using technology and digital environments. Terras focuses on the link between the crowdsourcing project’s design to effectively generate descriptive content, and the effects that this would have on access.
<br>
<br>
The differences between these definitions are representative of the variety of ways crowdsourcing projects have been approached, and the large body of scholarship that exists, meaning that the definition often relies on the context of its use. Among others, Daren Brabham’s proposed typology for crowdsourcing projects provides a way to step back and think about the type of problem being addressed, and the mechanism used to solve it.<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup> Brabham identifies information management issues, most typical of galleries, archives, libraries, and museums (GLAMs) and the humanities, which deal with locating, creating, assembling, sorting, or analyzing information with the use of micro-tasks.<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup> His solution to these problems is what he calls, distributed human intelligence tasking: when “a corpus of data is known and the problem is not to produce designs, find information, or develop solutions, but to process data.”<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup>  Tasking to this end, is how crowdsourcing is organized. 
<br>
<br>
This paper will explore how archival description is recreated in crowdsource tasking, arguing that crowdsourcing reveals the infrastructure of archival processes which are usually hidden from the user, and forces them to be closer examined as extensions or expansion of archival power and the role of the archivist. This examination not only furthers postmodernist views that the archive asserts power by classifying and constructing knowledge around the objects they contain, but also asks for solutions to how that description can best be represented, integrated to promote access and reuse, sharing the archival power description affords, and lastly, calls for a reimagining of what archival stewardship and records management looks like within the future of digital archives. Ultimately this paper seeks to act as a condensed review of the literature on crowdsourcing, while also focusing on a few specific projects that deal with describing existing archival holdings through transcription and classifying tasking types. The projects closely examined are The Huntington Library’s Decoding the Civil War, and the Library of Congress’ By the People campaign Clara Barton: Angel of the Battlefield, all other projects briefly mentioned were from sources, or only reviewed for specific information. These crowdsourcing projects are distinguished from user-generated born-digital archives, or digital community archives like Journal of the Plague Year, We are Wales, the Willi Smith Community Archive, StoryCorps Archive, or Deep Cities (Curbatheri), as these projects, while often referred to as crowdsourcing and rely on some of the same principles, face different challenges compared to physical repositories transitioning to a digital environment.
<br>
<br>
</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>
  Since the early 1990s postmodernism has affected archival studies to more openly acknowledge the power and privilege that are at play in the archival process.<sup><a href="#7">7</a></sup>  Every point within the lifecycle of archival records is inherently biased, reflecting particular world-views, and constructed to meet specific purposes.<sup><a href="#8">8</a></sup> There is no way to escape this. With the lack of resources, and overwhelming amount of historical material, even after archival selection ingests fractions of it, some objects will receive, full, partial, or no attention.<sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup> Archival arrangement and description is just one moment of the archival process that constructs meaning and knowledge. It is concerned with the classification and organization of historical objects in an archive, and the data of historical objects, or the data of data (the metadata) that entails describing the content and the context of those objects. Postmodernism as a theoretical framework, asserts that description comes with the power to make and remake archival records, determining how they will be used in the future; because each description becomes a part of a story that the objects and their records tell, a story that is continuous, constantly shifting and part of the broader context of society, archivists have the power to impact what story is told, or in effect create meaning from their descriptions.<sup><a href="#10">10 </a><a href="#11"></a></sup>   
<br>
<br>
Building on this recognition of archival description as dynamic and interpretational, Greg Bak proposes that description is an archival object, where the process of how information was gathered should be represented alongside the information itself.<sup><a href="#12">12</a></sup>  In this conception of archival description, it creates a responsibility and a method of accountability for archivists, records managers, community members, and researchers who inform archival description, by being more transparent about the policies surrounding descriptive practice, who performs it, and the end use.<sup><a href="#13">13</a></sup>  In this conception of archival description there is not necessarily a divide between community description and institutional description, but layers of archival objects that inform each other through shared practices. It calls attention to the differences between digital repositories and physical repositories, acknowledging that these environments enable different goals, and different practices to help achieve them. The logic of the digital archive being different from that of a physical one.<sup><a href="#14">14</a></sup> 
<br>
<br>
In the tradition of physical repositories, description has been constructed through hierarchical structures, grouped by the principles of provenance, respect des fonds and original order, to form context and relationships between historical objects and subjects. Ontologies, or classification systems, and controlled vocabularies are imposed to further define context, relationships, and content. These aspects of the process of description function to both control access and authenticity, while still connecting researchers and users to materials, making them more effectively searched and retrieved.15  It should be recognized that what arrangement and description is for, and how the principles are used, are highly debated and outside the scope of this paper.<sup><a href="#16">16 </a><a href="#17">17 </a><a href="#18">18</a></sup> It is generally considered that more description means furthering the reach of collections, and providing more access.
<br>
<br>
The final product meant for users and enabling this access, is usually a finding aid. When finding aids were hosted by institutions on the Internet, their conception was reworked to become more searchable, whether in a text-based PDF or a webpage with headings and sections to guide a user, or more unconventional methods. In both the physical and the digital context, finding aids do not reveal all of the metadata and description an institution may have on a historical object it holds, nor will it reveal any information about how that description was created. Especially when finding aids and collection search boxes work well, researchers and users do not often question it, the process acts as hidden infrastructure guiding them to what they need. The user only knows of the input (the historical objects or holdings of an institution) and the output (the finding aid or website search box), making the archive perform as a black box, hiding the complex internal descriptive process, and subsequently effecting how they are used and reused.<sup><a href="#19"></a></sup>  This is possible primarily because this work is being performed by professional archivists sometimes physically and intellectually separated from the context and subjects of these archival objects, coming from a legacy of archival work where the archivists' role and aspirations were tied to archival description, allowing them to be the mediator between the holdings and the users, as well as a history of archival work within the colonial and administrative processes of the state.<sup><a href="20">20</a></sup> Postmodernism was a shift not only in the way these processes were conceptualized as power, as infrastructure, but also a shift in thinking about the archivist's role within these processes. 
<br>
<br>
Beyond the transformation of the finding aid, digitization efforts had created (are still creating) digital representations of analog collections in unstructured formats like image files, sound files, video files, that while now online, are not searchable, interoperable, or interrogable.<sup><a href="#21">21</a></sup>  The potential of the digital collection depends on the structure of metadata and descriptive content, all of which has to be generated to perform for these contexts based on a machine's ability to read and extract information based on a search. The use of crowdsourcing was conceived to make this process quicker, addressing backlog, improving access points, while also presenting opportunities to engage with an established community in a deeper way, allowing different classifications, tags, and language to be used in description.<sup><a href="#22">22</a></sup>  The digital environment of the Internet, Web 2.0, and crowdsourcing became a tool of the participatory archive, to face the constructed, biased nature of individuals and institutions, the power they held through description, and as a means to be able to bring new voices to archival objects, distributing the power and authority to others.<sup><a href="#23">23</a></sup>
<br>
<br>
This has created tension in a variety of ways, whether between practical collections management issues and theory-based professional ideals, as well as between professional archivists and user groups in their motivations or authority, between physical repositories and digital repositories, or as is the focus of this paper, between data collected and its subsequent access and reuse, all largely centered around professionals letting go of their control of archival processes and adapting to new technologies.<sup><a href="#24">24</a></sup> The dominant practices archivists have devised to receive contributions from users are sharing information, adding new content, commenting, tagging with folksonomies or local controlled vocabularies, transcription, and text-correction of optical character recognition (OCR) or speech-to-text software generated files. Whether their motivations are to distribute the power of that description affords, to just see new perspectives, or to work faster through backlog and increase access points, it has forced them to recreate the process of archival description in some capacity. Crowdsourcing thereby reveals archival infrastructure and opens the black box to users, while also asking archivists to confront their processes. 
</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2 id="examining">Examining Tasking</h2>
<p>
  This brings us back to Brabham's typifying of crowdsourcing, as “micro-tasks,” and distributed human intelligence tasking. From what has been outlined about the archival description as a practice of professional archivists, it is not “just processing data,” but involves a variety of interpretive skills and information gathering to construct meaning and stories about historical objects. Looking at archival description within microtasking using the projects Decoding the Civil War, where information was viewed online, and supplemented with phone correspondence from the project's lead at the Huntington Library, and with By the People's Clara Barton: Angel of the Battlefield campaign, resources were only examined online through the crowdsourcing platforms, institutional website, blog posts, and GitHub pages.
<br>
<br>
There are many stages and elements that aid in designing a compelling crowdsourcing project, the structure of tasking and its implications will be the only ones covered here.<sup><a href="#25">25 </a><a href="#26">26 </a><a href="#27">27 </a><a href="#28">28</a></sup> Knowledge organization and structure of generated content must be considered from the start of a project.<sup><a href="#29">29</a></sup> This is to ensure the content generated has meaning beyond a general feeling of participation and socialization, and is integrated into established archival systems or records, becoming findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable according to FAIR guiding principles.<sup><a href="#30">30</a></sup> This looks like encoded machine-readable text, linked data formatting, datasets, images, video or audio, all hosted in a public and open access setting with additional explanation of how to read each file.<sup><a href="#31">31</a></sup> Microtasking, or the breaking down of archival description into quick, intuitive, distinctive, manageable tasks, became the answer to project organization in crowdsourcing because it was easy to oversee in a digital medium, and provided results that easily translated into the formation of structured data. It is a strategic project management method, where smaller goals are created to eventually form one larger goal.
<br>
<br>
Tasks can represent one of many levels of description, gaining complexity as each task is completed. For example, in Decoding the Civil War project on Zooniverse, participants on the platform were asked to transcribe and classify telegrams and codebooks in the form of high-resolution image files. This was phase one of a project, then phase two would ask participants to extract specific metadata from the transcriptions, like sender, recipient, date sent. In the Clara Barton campaign, after transcription of personal papers and manuscripts was completed, tags and classifications could be added to materials. These are levels of description that in the analog archive may have been accomplished simultaneously by one or two professionals, moving between data extraction and other levels of interpretation simultaneously, relying solely on the processing archivist's perspectives about the materials relationships and their wider context.
<br>
<br>
By expanding the process of description to the crowd, levels of the process are made distinct by tasks. Though each level builds upon each other, at each level there is opportunity to make room for contrasting, interpretive, and expansionary description if the project supports it. What crowdsourcing relies on, what distinguishes it as either an extension of the archivist's vision, or expanding to share power, including other perspectives and knowledge, is the structure of the project, how much time, energy, and thought goes into the digital platform and the tools to support participation. In a blog post on the Clara Barton campaign written by a historian in the Library of Congress's manuscript division, the author writes lengthily about the detective work performed to transcribe a name used in a diary entry. The historian consulted numerous sources all digitally available, to corroborate the name unknown by volunteers. This blog post is an example of the division between the expectations of how professionals contribute to resources, and how volunteers contribute, and the use of tasking levels reinforces this. Users process the data quickly, skipping over things they do not know in these projects. The design is not for volunteers to do their own interpretive work, even though it is readily available to them through digital archival collections.
<br>
<br>
Education was a large part of Decoding the Civil War. Learning modules split into three types of pedagogy, Inquiries, Explainers, and Activities, where the codebooks and telegrams of the project were contextualized with other materials from The Huntington's collection, as well as enforcing a foundation of skills to help participants analyze 19th century handwriting and subjects.<sup><a href="#32">32</a></sup> Even though the institution was extremely invested in providing support and resources to investigate what they were transcribing, it still only amounted to tasks that were data processing, preparing materials for the professionals to review and take closer looks. Tasks need instruction that is thorough and clear to ensure a good standard of work, ease of use and understanding, and a starting point for all users to invest in a project. There also needs to be systems to check interpretations, so workflows encapsulating levels of review still need to occur.
<br>
<br>
Though transcription is not a neutral process, constructed like any other form of archival description, as reading is a personal and subjective activity, and reading from difficult handwriting that never anticipated being poured over by others, holds the potential for some interpretations to be privileged over others, it is not exactly the radical imaginings of the participatory archive where free form knowledge is shared, a “deeper involvement and more complex semantics,” is occurring between participant and archivist over historical materials.<sup><a href="#33">33 </a><a href="#34">34</a></sup> There was not a structure to encourage research and investigation by volunteers after a foundation of transcription had been set. It is this division set by “if you do not know, move on,” type of tasking and the archivist's review that is still coming from an overall vision of the archivist as singular authority.
<br>
<br>
In some cases, the more complex tasks are never realized due to funding. Phase two of Decoding the Civil War was not realized, but if it had, super-volunteers would have been emailed directly, asking for another level of commitment in using the transcribed code books to decode the telegrams.<sup><a href="#35">35</a></sup> More education to explain professional standards, contexts, knowledge, and digital tools, would need to be provided, but users would be more involved in the process than before, informing it structure and engaging in interpretation. These interpretations would form a new record, linked to the code books and corresponding telegrams, though made clear that the decoding had been done in the present day. Other examples of more complex and interpretational tasking are out there, where projects gave users the skillsets and pedagogical framework of professionals in the field.<sup><a href="#36">36</a></sup> But this is still not the same as sharing authority, as the methods and process of the crowdsourcing project is not maintained in the archival record, remaining an invisible archival infrastructure. It is only the final product that a new record, or is added to an existing one. This is a problem also identified by Bak, and is continued in the examination of how data is integrated and offered as publicly available.<sup><a href="#37">37</a></sup>
<br>
<br>
Here it will be noted that with the right pedagogy, digital tools, and online platform in combination with the layering of task complexity, users can be taught to recreate professional skill sets and apply standard ontologies, but this extends Elizabeth Yakel's question of how much are archivists willing to share, to how much are they able to share?<sup><a href="#38">38</a></sup> Besides the limitations of funding and time to build these platforms and education tools, meet and collaborate with participants over the construction of each ontology and descriptive practice, there is an ethical question of how much labor you can require of user participants, especially when what is being asked may disrupt the nature of volunteer work, to easily come and go, working as you please, as well as take away salaried work from new professionals in the field, limiting the expansion of job titles, specializations, and shared responsibilities among professionals. This is another examination of crowdsourcing in itself, calling into question how crowdsourcing participates in capitalist distinctions of skilled or unskilled labor, and Marxist ideas of the effects of cheap labor on industry and fair compensation. Using crowdsourcing at more complex levels of interpretation, ideation, and collaboration have been touched on by Melissa Terras, who points to organizations grappling with crowdsourcing in this way.<sup><a href="#39">39</a></sup>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<h2 id="integrating">Integrating Crowdsourcing Data</h2>
<p>
  As for how the structured descriptive content that was generated from crowdsourcing is used by the archive, is an area that is still being explored, usually by using specific projects as case studies.<sup><a href="#40">40 </a><a href="#41">41 </a><a href="#42">42 </a><a href="#43">43</a></sup> For most part though, the processes and complexities connecting knowledge organization, generating the content, and sharing or using the content are not represented in the literature as one would expect.<sup><a href="#44">44 </a><a href="#45">45</a></sup> The issue of transparency in the archival record is directly correlated in the literature about crowdsourcing projects, with much more focus being on how to involve a wide participant base, how to create a task, funding, and attention. Though this shift is being made, and newer projects are supplemented with more technical materials. This observation again centers the question: if archival description informs interactions, interpretations, research, and social memory, must that not be extensively reported on and recorded in archival records like finding aids and institutional websites?<sup><a href="#46">46</a></sup> A problem faced when writing this paper was that closer analysis of how user generated data was formatted, made accessible, and recorded was difficult to grasp without having actually worked on a project or done more extensive interviews with all the teams that collaborate on a project like this. 
<br>
<br>
Decoding the Civil War linked the crowdsourcing project to the institutional holding webpage as a method of integration. They provide the transcription that was created by volunteers under the heading “transcript,” which is separate from the more conventional looking metadata under, “object description,” it is not a separate file. Speaking with Mario Einaudi, developers from Zooniverse worked with them on the entire project. Zooniverse has its own internal programs that reviewed transcriptions, comparing versions of volunteers, and producing a final copy.<sup><a href="#47">47</a></sup>  It also aggregated classifications and transcriptions generated by volunteers into .csv files and JSON elements that can then be used later, though it is unclear where those are hosted.<sup><a href="#48">48</a></sup>  Credit is only given to Zooniverse volunteers in a catalog note. The institutional record is relying on the continual hosting of the Zooniverse site to provide deeper insight into the process of description. When this is removed the catalog note will most likely be the only record of the project. Regarding more complex phases of the project, the archival record would have never reflected the process of description, or as reliance on specific groups of volunteers grew, their names.<sup><a href="#49">49</a></sup>
<br>
<br>
Looking at the Clara Barton campaign from By the People, the institutional record is linked from the project page. In the institutional record there is a linked text file. There is no mention of how the transcription was generated, the campaign, or the volunteers. In a separate blog published piece, the By the People workflow is documented, and in a description on By the People's website there is mention of how to access zipped .csv datasets from collections.<sup><a href="#50">50 </a><a href="#51">51</a></sup> So far Clara Barto's manuscripts do not have an associated dataset. But looking at other campaigns that do, the dataset is its own record, with a link to the campaign website, the historical collection that formed the dataset, and the contributor lists the creator of the historical objects and the By the People program.<sup><a href="#52">52</a></sup> This is a good example of how archival description can be created as its own record, and linked in a productive way that starts to illuminate a process. There is also documentation on the process in a published article, though this is still removed from the record on a permanently hosted website.
<br>
<br>
In linking between project platform and institutional platform, volunteer participation is still working in the context of the physical repository, presenting only input and output, access mediated by professionals. Using the expanded definition of archival description where descriptive data is itself an archival object, could open new ways of structuring the platforms and project outcomes of crowdsourcing.<sup><a href="#53">53</a></sup> The By the People's dataset records is a start to how this might be achieved. This paper continues to wonder what does transparency look like in the archival record? What does valuing distributed power and diverse representation look like? Is the ideal of the participatory archive meeting institutions where they are? If not, how are institutions going to develop to match the pace of technology and user expectations? What is this asking archivist and the archive to become? How has the role of the archivist changed? As digital collections grow, and more attention and resources are given to these online platforms and digital tools, is space for the user's input in the ontologies of archival description being considered?
<br>
<br>
</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>
  Through the investigations of crowdsourcing tasking and the solutions to integrating user contributions, show that the values of archival practice are ambivalent, unwilling to move completely towards participatory models, with little attention given back to the institutional record. While the process of archival description is broken down, it has not changed, evident in the lack of allowances for more interpretive projects, and transparency of the process as a record itself in the institution's holdings. It is ultimately up to each project manager, institution, archivist, and crowdsourcing platform to decide how much information and training participants receive, and this directly affects how much input users have over the process and construction of description. Most of the literature consulted, concluded that crowdsourcing is not the answer to shared archival power.<sup><a href="#54">54 </a><a href="#55">55</a></sup> Instead, it has been decidedly demonstrated that, “user engagement is portrayed as a recognition and reinforcement of established identities through the incorporation of additional user knowledge into the existing professional domain of practice, rather than necessarily a source of innovation and creativity via an encountered heterogeneity of external opinion.”<sup><a href="#56">56</a></sup> Alexandra Eveleigh's saw the future of crowdsourcing in Susanne Justesen's “incremental innovation,” where small-scale change will be made in individual institutions, redefining archival practice to blur the boundary between professional archivist and user participant.<sup><a href="#57">57 </a><a href="#58">58</a></sup>
<br>
<br>
To move beyond solutions crowdsourcing has offered, will start with more radical conceptions of the archivist's role, both in education and practice. It will also largely depend on the investment in the digital repository. Digital environments for archival collections offer chances to reexamine the way things are done and a new role for the archivist.<sup><a href="#59">59</a></sup> This adapted role must accommodate digital tools and platforms, with the continued expectation for the archivist to provide advocacy, guidance, advice, and education, as well as adapting to be project manager, motivator, user experience designer, moderator, and collaborator.<sup><a href="#60">60</a></sup> Lorraine Dong asks if by decentralizing the record, reconceptualizing the finding aid, will the archival profession similarly be fragmented?<sup><a href="#61">61</a></sup> Instead of viewing this adaptation as fragmentary, it can be thought of as community building, centering values of responsibility through transparency and accountability. This comes through lasting documentation of how records are described as Bak argues.<sup><a href="#62">62</a></sup> Online, users now have similar resources as the professionals, and information is not linear, but scattered, linked, waiting to be assembled and explored according to searches, investigations, and collaboration.<sup><a href="#63">63</a></sup> Archivists may shake the need for guarded access of materials, singular trust in their own interpretative and detective skills, broadening metadata schemas, controlled vocabularies, and hierarchical structures, finding new ways to add layers of interpretation and information to collections, creating dialog and engaging deeply with history and social memory.<sup><a href="#64"></a></sup>
<br>
<br>
Community archives, inclusion of critical race theory, women and gender studies, cases for the de-standardization of archival practice and the rise of the digital humanities as a field support this reevaluation of how the archivist manages and curates historical materials.<sup><a href="#65">65 </a><a href="#66">66 </a><a href="#67">67 </a><a href="#68">68</a></sup> The focus of user participation becomes not just about the construction of archival description, but an additional evaluation of the construction of digital environments that enable this participation; the practices of how content is put online, not just the practices that generate the content.<sup><a href="#69">69</a></sup> In agreement with these approaches, a movement towards small scale change, thinking of each crowd as communities of practice, and therefore treating each archive as a community archive where there are specific, intentional approaches to provide the interface and mechanisms for users who are motivated and connected to historical material, is what will eventually make way for larger forms of connection.<sup><a href="#70">70</a></sup>
<br>
<br>
The crowd, much like the public, has never been a faceless, nebulous, unknown entity, but for most institutions it means a core group of researchers, retired professionals, descendants, enthusiasts, collectors, and regular readers. In order to move away and transform the type of description that, as Luciana Duranti put it, “in order to be useful for every kind of research, had to serve none in particular,” will require more customizable approaches, tools, and platforms.<sup><a href="#71">71</a></sup> Acknowledging and being transparent about the bias description carries, can be taken further, where intentional-biasing can act as a research question, and as foundations of digital representation are built, more voices and perspectives, more questions, can be used to extract data and form layers of archival records. With flexible web platform design, these descriptions can be layered as digital records, each equal in the weight they carry.<sup><a href="#72">72</a></sup>
<br>

Digital visualizations like this are part of the digital humanities, it is possible that this type of experience, where description will be created like research data with the goal and construction of the research agreed upon by close-knit users, generating a final digital product acting as an archive, where more users can supply input, interact, and openly communicate with the creators, will become the new archival experience. But this is speaking to the future, as archivists are still struggling to represent the current complexity of descriptive processes digitally, and real practical issues are still impeding many digital efforts.<sup><a href="#73">73</a></sup> Projects that were found due to this research that are due more investigation are the European Digital Treasures project, and Mia Ridge's Collective Wisdom project. Change is slow and a wider foundation of digitization needs to be realized, but it is essential to think of the implications for emerging archival and library professionals, the education, experience and background that they will need, and it can never be a bad thing to continually remind the field at the beginning of projects that more radical development and construction needs to be explored.
