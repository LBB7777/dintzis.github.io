<h2>Core Courses</h2>
<h3>IS 212 Communities and Values | Dr. Ulia Gosart | Fall 2021</h3>
  <p>For a final group project in this course, we chose the research topic zines in libraries. As a group we created a 25 page annotated bibliography on the relationship between the communities that create zines and libraries that collect them. As part of our presentation, we created <a href="pdfs/IS212_final_zine.pdf" target="_blank"><u>a digital zine, which can be read here.</u></a> Glen Theory Sturgeon completely designed and formatted the zine, while the rest of our group generated information that contributed to the text. <a href="pdfs/IS212_annotated_bibliography.pdf"><u>Here is the final annotated bibliography as well.</u></a></p>
    <br><br>
<h3>IS 211 Artifacts and Cultures | Dr. Jonathan Furner | Fall 2021</h3>
  <p><a href="pdfs/IS211_fourassignments.pdf" target="_blank"><u>These four assignments</u></a> were cumulative exercises that allowed us to imagine ourselves in roles at fictional or real cultural heritage institutions, and were meant to guide us through different responsibilities within these roles anchored by one artifact we deemed a valuable addition to a collection. Specifically these responsibilities were acquisition, exhibition description, evaluation criteria, and a lesson plan as an example of outreach. The last assignment was thought of with other students looking at our artifacts as a small collection and uniting them with larger themes.</p>
    <br><br>
<h2>Electives</h2>
<h3>IS 439 Special Collections | Dr. Rob Montoya | Spring 2022</h3>
  <p>For this course, the final project was to create <a href="pdfs/IS439_researchguide.pdf" target="_blank"><u>a primary source research guide</u></a> for an undergraduate course taught at UCLA. I created a guide for students in Cluster M71CW: Spaces of Biotechnology as an exercise in primary source literacy instruction.</p>
    <br><br>
<h3>IS 279 User Experience Design | Dr. Lynn Boyden | Fall 2022</h3>
  <p>With a group of other students, we worked with <a href="https://pds-imaging.jpl.nasa.gov" target="_blank"><u>JPL Nasa's Cartography and Imaging Node</u></a> to assess their website in order to enhance user understanding, usability, and ease of access. We tested their site among different user groups, then analyzed these interviews to generate recommended changes, which we then compiled into a report and formally presented to them. <a href="pdfs/IS279_UXdesign_FinalReport.pdf"><u>Here is our report</u></a>, which additionally includes our outreach efforts, interview questions, and site map.</p>
    <br><br>
<h3>IS 262A Data Mangement and Practice | Dr. Jillian Wallis | Fall 2022</h3>
  <p>The culmination of this course was the creation of a data curation profile for the field of mycology using OpenRefine and publishing to UCLA's Dataverse and Open Science Framework. The <a href="https://osf.io/7a3yz/?view_only=d1008598c4ec48df8ef982a1e59ebbd5"><u>>project and data can be viewed here</u></a> on Open Science Framework.</p>
    <br> <br>
<h3>DH 201 Introduction to Digital Humanities | Dr. Miriam Posner | Winter 2023</h3>
  <p>This course prepared me to create a digital project exploring how data can be visualized and used to tell a story. You can see <a href="spider.html" target="_blank"><u>my project called Spider News on my website.</u></a></p>
    <br><br>
<h3>Internship Work</h3>
<p>As part of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation Internship Program, I wrote a blog post reflecting on my time at the June L. Mazer Lesbian Archivs. It can be found on <a href="https://communityarchiveslab.ucla.edu/ucla-community-archives-lab-andrew-w-mellon-foundation-blog/"><u>here on the Community Archives Lab website.</u></a></p>
