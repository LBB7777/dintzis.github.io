  <h2>Web accessibility Report</h2>
  <p>I believe information on the Web should be accessible to people using assistive devices and settings, as well as those facing other physical or technological barriers to internet use. This website was designed with accessibility features in mind. This accessibility statement is generated to show how this site complies and falls short of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1. It was generated using the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/statements/generator/#create" target="_blank"><u>Web Accessibility Initiative&#39s free accessibility statement generator</u></a> and with the <a href="https://www.boia.org/products/free-wcag-2-0-aa-report/" target="_blank"><u>Bureau of Internet Accessibility&#39s free website analysis tool.</u></a></p>
<br>
<p>The elements of my MLIS portfolio are also <a href="pdfs/Dintzis_Portfolio_Spring2023.pdf" target="_blank"><u>available as a printable PDF.</u></a></p>

          <h3>Conformance Status</h3>
          <p>The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) defines requirements for designers and developers to improve accessibility for people with disabilities. It defines three levels of conformance: Level A, Level AA, and Level AAA. My personal website is partially conformant with WCAG 2.1 level AA. Partially conformant means that some parts of the content do not fully conform to the accessibility standard criteria. According to the accessibility assessment, 24 out of 29 checkpoints were successful, with only 5 failures. These failures were checkpoints under the perceivable and operable principles and are as follows: 1.1.1 Nontext Content, 1.3.1 Info and Relationships, 1.4.1 Use of Color, 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks, and 2.4.4 Link Purpose (in context). I am continuing to improve my web design skills that will remedy these non-compliant elements.</p>
          <br><h3>Technical Specifications</h3>
          <p>Accessibility of my website relies on HTML and CSS to work with the particular combination of web browser and any assistive technologies or plugins installed on your computer. I have used <a href="Bulma.io">Bulma.io</a> CSS stylesheets to design this site. While features of the site are compatible with most browsers, without JavaScript the website is not recommended for mobile viewing as the site menus can be visually overwhelming.</p>
          <br><h3>Limitations</h3>
          <p>No users with disabilities were consulted when designing this webpage. There are issues with ease of use with assistive technology like screen readers, as well as issues with conveying meaning only with visual means. The zine and research guide I created for IS212 Communities and Values and IS439 Special Collections respectively, are reliant on images with text, and therefore cannot be read by screen readers. My project for digital humanities contains charts that use color to distinguish between different categories and while those with colorblindness or low-vision were kept in mind when choosing colors, this still excludes those who use screen readers to a certain extent. I encourage feedback addressing any of these issues to be submitted through my GitHub page, or by emailing me directly.</p>
