<h2 id="top">Choosing an MLIS Degree</h2>
<p>I was first able to conceptualize information studies while engaging with public history and art history after doing research in my university's archive, and spending my undergraduate career examining the history of collecting through my coursework. This is how and where I observed the impact acts of preservation, memory work, and artistic creation had on the city and the communities around me. These experiences gave rise to questions in my mind of archival silences, power, ethics, and how archives are able to serve communities. I came into the MLIS program at UCLA eager to learn how these questions were explored in the field, and how information professionals used their skills to support people. Beyond exploring these issues, I found room to expand my interests and learned foundational skills that I can carry with me into my professional career.</p>
<br><br>
<h2>Integrating my interests</h2>
<p>Part of the reason I decided to move across the country for this MLIS program is because I am particularly passionate about how science can intersect with information studies, and related areas of work including: science communication, life sciences, science history, environmental humanities, and community science. There are many Los Angeles institutions where I could explore my interests like the Natural History Museum of LA County, the Lorquin Society, UC Riverside's Entomology Museum, and UCLA's robust life sciences programs. Because I am only an amateur enthusiast in all things bugs, plants, and animals, and my background is in arts institutions and the humanities, this gave me reservations about pursuing work in science collections and more data management positions. Despite my concerns I have focused my projects in this program on science collections, and I began volunteering at the UCLA Herbarium in the Spring quarter of my first year. The UCLA Herbarium is a specimen collection of vascular plants of Southern California and was a welcoming space to learn more about how information science meets life sciences, and what I can do to apply what I've learned in my degree to get more involved in community science programs, entomological outreach, and community gardens or seed libraries.</p>
<br><br>
<h2>Influential courses</h2>
<p>In this program, I was especially drawn to the courses that related to computing, web technologies, and digital infrastructure's importance in relation to libraries, archives, and museums. After taking Digital Preservation with Dr. Anne Gilliland and the Systems and Infrastructures core course with Dr. Miriam Posner, I was encouraged to pursue digital humanities coursework, and courses that have developed skills such as web design, user experience design, digital asset management, data visualization, and data curation. I hope to seek positions that prioritize continuous learning about front-end technologies, information technology systems, tools for data management practice, and participatory design. These technologies are an integral part of the transformation of archival practice, to move away from gatekeeping, and can help to make archives more accessible, transparent, and collaborative places. I have a strong mission to sustain relationships, share power, honor feelings, and focus on use, activation, and access within roles that generate description, publications, user interfaces, and communication.</p>
<br><br>
<h2>Professional experiences</h2>
<p>This program has also expanded the scope of my professional skills by exposing me to media archiving and preservation work. My position at the IS Library and Media Lab not only created a space where I could learn collaboratively with my cohort after having been isolated on Zoom for a year, but also facilitated a space where I became passionate about preserving recorded sound, film, and video. To further my knowledge around media archiving, I am also a part of the student chapter of Associations for Recording Sound Collections (ARSC) at UCLA and am excited to continue learning about how to assess and preserve vulnerable media with my cohort through events and workshops.</p>
<br>
<p>The Community Archives course with Dr. Michelle Caswell prompted me to apply for and receive the Mellon funded Community Archives Lab Internship at the June L. Mazer Lesbian Archives, where I could also exercise commitments and actions towards community-focused work, and play with the methods that disrupt archival professional practice while honing my skills in digital content management. It was here that I was able to explore questions I had about how archives are able to serve communities; and discuss the challenges and considerations of identity-based archival work.</p>
<br>
<p>At the Mazer I was also able to continue pursuing working with recorded sound media. I worked on two collections of oral histories: digital interviews conducted by students from Dr. Marie Cartier's Queer Studies course at California State University, Northridge; and tapes from the Lillian Faderman Cassette Tape Collection, which I digitized in the IS Media and Preservation Lab. This experience led me to begin the creation of a zine on digital oral history file management for donating oral histories to the Mazer, and share and collaborate on other audio preservation projects with IS faculty and students.</p>
<br><br>
<h2>Professional organizations</h2>
<p>My path through this program led me to become a member of Code4lib, ARSC, and become a signatory of the Design Justice Network. In my future professional development, I will attend conferences with these organizations, and others such as the Zine Librarians Conference, Henry Stewart DAM conferences, and Alliance of Digital Humanities Conferences. I hope to take an active role in working groups and committees from these organizations that will allow me to develop teaching and collaborative tools to bring these principles further into my work. I am also a student member of the Society of California Archivists, where I actively take part in their professional development workshops, and very recently joined the California Archivists' Collective. I am excited to do work and make connections within both of these local professional organizations, and stay on top of current topics in the field.</p>
