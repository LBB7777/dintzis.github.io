<h2>Choosing an MLIS Degree</h2>
<p>My exposure to information studies took place while engaging with public history and art history, where I observed  the impact acts of preservation, memory work, and artistic creation had on the city and communities around me. So when I arrived at UCLA to begin my MLIS degree program, questions of archival silences, power, ethics, and how archives are able to serve communities were on my mind. I was eager to learn how these questions were explored in the field, and how information professionals used their skills to support people. In this program I learned foundational skills, through which I explored these issues. </p>
<br><br>
<h2>Integrating my interests</h2>
<p>I am particularly passionate about science communication, life sciences, science history, environmental humanities, and community science, and my goal is to take positions in special collections, libraries, and archives in public museums or academic settings concerning science history and natural sciences. I am only an amateur enthusiast in all things bugs, plants, and animals, so I had reservations about making my way into a field in which I had little academic training. I started volunteering at the UCLA Herbarium in the Spring quarter of my first year, and after my degree I hope to get more involved in community science programs, community gardens, and food justice organizations. Throughout my coursework and professional experiences I kept topics of science in mind for projects and papers.</p>
<br><br>
<h2>Influential courses</h2>
<p>After taking Digital Preservation with Dr. Gilliland and the core course Systems and Infrastructure with Dr. Posner, I started to engage with computing, web technologies, and digital infrastructure's importance in libraries, archives, and museums. This encouraged me to pursue Digital Humanities coursework, and courses that developed skills such as web design, user experience design, digital asset management, data visualization, and data curation. I now hope to seek positions where continuing to learn front-end technologies, information technology systems, tools for data management practice, and participatory design are a priority. These technologies are part of the transformation of archival practice, moving away from gatekeeping, and can help to make archives more transparent, collaborative places, and facilitate resources to wider audiences.
<br><br>
Another course that was influential on my time in this program was Dr. Caswell's Community Archives. It was here that the questions I had about how archives are able to serve communities were deeply explored considering on-the-ground, practical approaches through post-custodial work, community autonomy, and relationship building. In my role as an archivist or librarian, my commitments lie with decentering whiteness, divesting from colonial practice, and challenging white supremacy that appears in professional culture. Within roles that generate description, publications, user interfaces, and communication I have a strong mission to sustain relationships, share power, honor feeling, and focus on use, activation, and access. This course prompted me to apply for and receive the Mellon funded Community Archives Lab Internship at the June L. Mazer Lesbian Archives, where I not only was able to form relationships in a community that is personally relevant to me, but to exercise these commitments and actions, and play with methods that disrupt archival professional practice while honing my skills in digital content management.</p>
<br><br>
<h2>Professional experiences</h2>
<p> This program has also expanded my professional skills by exposing me to media archiving. My job at the IS Library and Media Lab not only created a space where I could learn collaboratively with my cohort after having been isolated on Zoom for a year, but also facilitated a space where I became passionate about preserving recorded sound, film, and video. I am now part of the student chapter of Associations for Recording Sound Collections (ARSC) at UCLA and am excited to continue learning about how to assess and preserve vulnerable media with my cohort through events and workshops.</p>
<br><br>
<h2>Professional organizations</h2>
<p>My path through this program led me to become a member of Code4lib, become a signatory of the Design Justice Network, and ARSC. In my future professional development I will attend conferences with these organizations, and others such as the Zine Librarians Conference, Henry Stewart DAM conferences, and Alliance of Digital Humanities Conferences. I hope to take an active role in working groups from these organizations that will allow me to develop teaching and collaborative tools to bring these principles further into my work.  I am also a student member of the Society of California Archivists, where I actively take part in their professional development workshops, and  I very recently joined the California Archivists' Collective. I  will continue to make connections within both of these professional organizations, and stay on top of current topics in the field.</p>
