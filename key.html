        <h2>What are spiders?</h2>
        <p>Spiders are arachnids. They are defined by their segmented bodies, exoskeleton, and jointed appendages, including eight legs, the chelicerae (short mouth-parts used to push food in), and the pedipalps which are prehensile touch organs.</p>
<br>
        <h2>Species Identification</h2>
        <p>Species labels are written in binomial nomenclature: this is how scientific names for living creatures are classified. The <i>bi</i> in binomial is the genus and species put together to name someone. The most well know examples of binomial nomenclature are <i>Homo sapien</i>, and <i>Tyrannesaurus rex.</i></p>
<br>
        <h2>Poisonous versus Venomous</h2>
        <p>It is important to keep in mind that poisonous refers to something capable of harming you when eaten or put inside your body. Venomous refers to something capable of harming you by injecting venom into you through a bite or sting. Some species of spider contain venom in order to paralyze their food. Luckily, humans are not on the menu. 50 out of the 40,000 species of spiders have chelicerae capable of penetrating human skin, with only 42 causing short&#45;term skin reactions.[1] [2]</p>
<br>
        <h2>Resources for Identification, Learning, and Spider Bites</h2>
        <p>The University of California, Riverside has an amazing entomology program, and many resources online abut arthropods in general. <a href="https://spiders.ucr.edu"><u>This one is specifically for spider information.</u></a></p>
        <br>
       <p>Another great <a href="https://www.topic.com/the-human-spider-struggle"><u>article on the fear of spiders,</u></a> and where I sourced my photographs for this project, is by Jessie Guy&#45;Ryan from <i>Topic.</i></p>
       <br>
        <p>And of course, make sure to contact your doctor or go to the nearest emergency room or urgent care if you think you are experiencing symptoms from a spider bite.</p>
