      <h2>The Worst That Could Happen</h2>
     <p>The Media plays a huge role in how people perceive events. The internet and online news media allows people access to stories immediately, from a variety of sources, platforms, and mediums. The chance for mis-information to spread is higher, and wider reaching with potentially catastrophic effects. The most cited example of how mis-information or &ldquo;fake news&rdquo; can have a major effect on human life is the public health and policy crisis that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
     <br>
      <p><a href="https://spiders.ucr.edu/internet-hoax"><u>When it comes to spiders,</u></a> mis-information does not have the same level of health related consequences, but because fear and disgust are the primary understanding towards this type of wildlife, general knowledge giving <a href="https://spiders.ucr.edu/internet-hoax"><u>people the ability to distinguish fact from fiction,</u></a> conservation policy, and scientific funding for use of spiders in health-related or agricultural-related projects are all at risk. The focus is disproportionately on the harm they can do and the threat they pose to people. 
      </p>
       <br>
      <p>So let&#39;s take a look at the consequences of the spider&#45;human interactions and the articles reporting on them collected by the database. The database collected whether each interaction resulted in a <b>bite</b>, a <i>deadly bite</i>, <b><i>both</b></i>, or neither. Not all of the bites resulted in a deadly bite, and surprisingly not all deaths reported a bite occurring.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The database is curated by articles, and information about the spider&#45;human interaction within those articles is recorded. This means there are duplicate articles that report on more than one interaction event, and duplicate interactions due to more than one article reporting on that event.</p>
      <br>
      <p>This gives us the opportunity to look at the result of each unique spider&#45;human  interaction, and how many articles reported on an event with a certain interaction result.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h2>The Spider&#45;Human Events</h2>
      <p>To get an accurate picture of how spiders effected humans during each interaction the database records, I cleaned the data to eliminate duplicate values across all fields related to the event reported. This revealed 2,643 unique spider&#45;human interaction events. The result of these interactions is reported in the graph below.</p>
      
      <div class="flourish-embed" data-src="story/1867764"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>      

      <p>Only 6.17% of the interactions between humans and spiders resulted in a person dying. This percentage is most likely even lower because of the small number of deaths that did not involve a spider bite, and most likely occurred from another cause. 47% involved a spider bite, which is low if you are considering what makes something news&#45;worthy.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Having this baseline understanding of how each reported interaction went will be helpful when looking at the data as a whole. If the number of deaths doubles, then it will show that more articles report on events that end in tragedy.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2>The News Articles</h2>
  <p>Of the news articles, 7.62% reported that a death occurred as a result of an interaction with a spider. The number of bites and the number of deaths remains relatively consistent with the information on interactions when the data was individualized.</p>

  <div class="flourish-embed" data-src="story/1867818"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>  
  
  <p>While this eliminates one way the media can skew the data through disproportionate reporting, the data captures ways the quality and content on how each spider-human event was reported affects people&#39;s feelings and understanding.</p>  
<br>
<br>

  <h2>Sensationalism and The Spiders</h2>
  <p>The total numbers of sensationalistic articles versus non-sensational articles was split approximately in half, and did not offer much insight. Instead, it seemed more productive to look at the types of words being used between sensational articles and non-sensational articles, and the dataset as a whole.</p>
<br>
    <p> Because of my own limited language skills, and the ability of Flourish to most accurately parse English titles, I only used titles in English from the larger dataset. This gave me 2,149 articles spanning 13 different countries.[1]</p>
<br>
<p> Below are word clouds for the titles of sensationalized news articles, and non-sensationalized news articles. Sensationalism was determined by the authors if overly emotional words, expressions, or images. Non-sensational was meant as neutral. I excluded common words like conjunctions, articles, and pronouns. I also excluded spider, spiders, variations of bite, words that were part of the names of spiders, as well as proper nouns.</p>

      <p>The top 10 words of the sensationalized article titles were venomous 148, deadly 136, leg 88, home 81, giant 61, huge 56, family 55, horror 51, poisonous 54, bananas 53. These titles are especially emotional, exaggerating fear-based emotions. The word poisonous is also an incorrect way to describe spider physicality, [see <a href="key.html"><u>The Key</u></a> ], but is an easily recognizable and scary word. The nouns and adjectives are not only the extreme (flesh&#45;eating stands out to me), but also speak to places that would be the last you&#39;d ever want to encounter a spider. For example, your home, in your grapes or bananas, a hospital, your bed, and on your body.</p>

      <br>
      <p>The top 10 for non-sensationalized article titles were found 81, venomous 60, grapes 56, home 41, dies 27, death and deadly 26, slayer 25, hospital 19, and family and guitarist 17. All of courses lower values in a smaller pool of titles, which is not quite evident from the side&#45;by&#45;side visualizations. The titles are not that different, besides a higher representation of &ldquo;grapes&rdquo;. Flesh&#45;eating is still present, and it now accompanies, baby and penis, two very vulnerable nouns. The noticeable difference is there is really only one term related to fear, and it is pretty neutral: scare. The other words seem blander, and out of context pretty meaningless.</p>
<br>
<br>
    <div class="flourish-embed" data-src="story/1867904"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
    <p>This last word cloud is the 100 top words from the dataset as a whole. This time words describing spiders were left in. The top words correspond with the top species of spiders the news articles covered. These 14 spiders are can puncture human skin, and do negatively affect humans, except for the Lycosa singoriensis, the wolf spider, who&#39;s has little effect on humans besides a bite as painful as a bee sting.</p>

<br>
<br>


      <h2>Errors</h2>
      <p>The real question is do these articles have an effect on the way people feel about spiders? Do they warrant this sensationalism? The top spiders being written about do pose a threat to humans if handled improperly, intentionally or unintentionally. While looking at the data as a whole gave no meaning to the sensationalism category, of the articles in English well over half are sensationalized. It is in Europe and North America that cultures of fear a disgust are most prevalent, and according to one scientist this is because of cultural perceptions, not biologically developed responses.[2] Things are so bad, even dead <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/tiktoker-goes-viral-after-spotting-enormous-spider-her-kitchen-1583000"><u>spiders are getting attention in the news,</u></a> because they are going viral on social media.
<br>
<br>
        Learning about spiders that can potentially cause humans to have serious symptoms should be reported on to educate people on what these spiders look like, how to identify them properly, and how to identify symptoms should they get bit. But fearmongering, and spreading misinformation will never help, and can cause people to panic instead of remaining calm in a situation that could impact them negatively, and a spider negatively. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>This chart correlates the number of articles that use sensationalism to the number of articles that used spider experts [arachnologists], to the number of articles that contained errors of any kind.</p>
        <div class="flourish-embed" data-src="story/1868345"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
    <br>
    <p>The most common types of errors across the four areas the database checked for, were venom errors: the broad category that checked whether the article accurately represented the toxicity of a spider&#39;s venom, the symptoms that occur after getting bit, and any medical information or how to get treatment. The next two highest [almost tied] was anatomy and taxonomic, meaning the spider was not described or identified correctly. The lowest number of errors was the accuracy of a photo, but 1,858 articles did not include a photo at all.</p>
